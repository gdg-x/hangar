#Namebadge Wordmerge
GDG Twin Cities used this to good success, we did the merging of the attendees list from Eventbrite, then uploaded the final merged doc to the local copy shop, they printed and cut the name badges to size.  We placed them in 4"x3" plastic badge holders like these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024KI4T8.

###Why
I am a programmer, not a word merger.  This burned way more time than I thought it would/should.  

###How
- We created different colored header and footer for the badge types (Attendee, Student, Sponsor, Speaker, Organizer).  Make a copy of the **Template Attendee.docx** file and change the parts you want.  Within the source sheet we moved the relevant group data to a different sheet and updated the merge source to the other sheet within the workbook. 
- After word merge, don't forget to visually check each page.  Some names are longer than the size allowed. In that case bump down the font.
- Kinkos said that it would have been helpful to have registration marks on the sheets to line up the cutter, but they did great anyhow.
- _NOTE:_ The resultant stack is not alphabetical from top to bottom.  If you can think of a wordmerge sort that is 3 dimensional like it would need to be post it!
